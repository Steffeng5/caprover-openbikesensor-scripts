# Overview
OBS-FACE is a Python script for Filtering, Annotating, Consolidating and Exporting OpenBikeSensor measurements stored in the
[OpenBikeSensor CSV-format](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensorFirmware/blob/master/docs/software/firmware/csv_format.mdhttps://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensorFirmware/blob/master/docs/software/firmware/csv_format.md).

## Filtering
Measurements with invalid time stamp, location or distance measurement are filtered out. Further, only confirmed measurements are kept.

In addition, usernames are replaced by pseudonyms, and only selected information are kept before exporting for visualization.

## Annotation
Each measurement is assigned to one _way_ as described by the OpenStreetMap data. GPS positions are corrected by 
projecting it to the way (snapping). Further, for each *confirmed* measurement, information from OpenStreetMap such as street name are duplicated to the measurement.

## Consolidating
All confirmed and valid measurements are collected and consolidated in one file in Json format.

## Export
The consolidated measurements are converted to GeoJson format and exported for visualization as required by the [OpenBikeSensor visualization](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensor-Scripts/tree/main/OBS-FACE-Visualization).

# Installation
Clone code

 `git clone https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensor-Scripts.git`

and go to the FACE subdirectory

 `cd OpenBikeSensor-Scripts/OBS-FACE`

## Requirements
The code is tested with [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/).

Also, install required Python packages:

`python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt `

# Usage

## Basic Usage
The default data directory is assumed to be

`./data/`

Place all OpenBikeSensor CSV files in subdirectories of `./data/input`: 

`./data/input/User1/`

`./data/input/User2/`

`./data/input/User3/`

etc. The expected file format is defined [here](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensorFirmware/blob/master/docs/software/firmware/csv_format.md). 

To filter, annotate and collect OpenBikeSensor measurements and export to GeoJson visualization data, run:

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" ` 

For measurement annotation, OpenStreetMap geographic data from district "Stuttgart" is used. Additional districts (Landkreise) can be added in this way (see below).

For each CSV-file in `./data/input`, one Json-file with annotated measurements as well as a log file is created in `./data/annotated`.

The consolidated, i.e. valid and confirmed measurements are collected in Json-format in

`./data/collected/measurements.json`

The data exported for visualization will be located in:

`./data/visualization/measurements.json`

contain confirmed, valid *measurements* in GeoJson format as expected by `measurements.html` in the [OBS-FACE visualization](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensor-Scripts/tree/main/OBS-FACE-Visualization) project. 
Further,

`./data/visualization/roads.json` 

contains confirmed, valid measurements consolidated to *road segments* in GeoJson format as expected 
by `road.html` in the [OBS-FACE visualization](https://github.com/openbikesensor/OpenBikeSensor-Scripts/tree/main/OBS-FACE-Visualization) project.



## Advanced Use
### Add More Districts

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -D "Pforzheim" -D "Enzkreis" -D "Landkreis BÃ¶blingen" -D "Landkreis Ludwigsburg" -D "Rems-Murr-Kreis" -D "Landkreis Esslingen"`

The name of the region is matched with the `name` tag of OpenStreetMap relations describing regions (Germany: *Kreis*), 
i.e. having the tag `boundary=administrative`, e.g. [Stuttgart](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/2793104). 

### Change Data base Directory
In case your data is located in a different directory, use:

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -b ./data_collection/Stuttgart/` 

In general, the default data structure is as following:

`BASEDIRECTORY/input/` input CSV files to be processed

`BASEDIRECTORY/annotated/` annotated measurements

`BASEDIRECTORY/collected/measurements.json` annotated, filtered and collected measurements

`BASEDIRECTORY/visualization/measurements.json` confirmed, valid measurements in GeoJson format 

`BASEDIRECTORY/visualization/roads.json` confirmed, valid measurements consolidated to road segments in GeoJson format

The base directory is changed by the `-b BASEDIRECTORY` option and defaults to `./data`. The paths can be further customized, see the full option list below.

### Exclude Input Files
To exclude subdirectories of the input, use:

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -e User3/` 

All files in`./data/input/User3/` and subdirectories will be excluded.

The exclusion path `User3/` is considered relative to the input directory path.

### Use Parallel Processing
Some of the time-consuming computations can be parallelized. Use

`python3.8 obs-face.py -ACV -D "Stuttgart" -p 4`

to use 4 worker processes. Note that this also increases the memory consumption significantly. 

### Map Cache
Downloaded OpenStreetMap maps and datastructures derived from them are cached in `./cache`. 
This reduces processing time, however map updates are ignored until the cache is flushed by deleting all files in the `./cache` directory.
